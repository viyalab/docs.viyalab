CLINK Pro is a communication device that can be used for remote platform devices such as ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles). The device provides high-speed and long-distance Ethernet connectivity and can utilize a standard Cat5 cable or any cable with twisted pairs as the communication medium. CLINK Pro includes a HomePlug module that uses the HomePlug AV (IEEE-1901) standard to transmit Ethernet data over power lines. This enables the use of power lines as the communication cable between devices. The device is designed to support both DC and AC signals on the communication line. 

:::note

To establish communication, you need to have at least 2 units of CLINK Pro.
